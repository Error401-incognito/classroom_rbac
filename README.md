# Classroom Management - RBAC UI (React.js)

## Description

This project is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI** for classroom management. It is designed to provide a secure and intuitive interface for managing classroom functionalities. The application is built using **React.js** for the frontend, allowing users to manage and interact with classroom activities based on their roles (Admin, Instructor, Student, etc.).
